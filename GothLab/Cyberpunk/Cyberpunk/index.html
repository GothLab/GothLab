Cybernetic sophistication of technological products merged with daft, dumb and desperate depression of punk nigilism.</p><ul><li>theme<br>Emotional noir, social dramma, sick moral joke. Viloence lust, kawai domination / underdogs crawling for justice. Imagination works on stored data. Eveything you imagine consist of parts information you observed and absorbed. Historyus a scuebce about presence as it becoming from past. Thinking is a quiality of a highly complex matter. We reflect and each reflection is absorbed in a words and exists as a thought.

Duality and part of fight of oppositise. Essense of humanity as what makes a human is social realtions. There are differences betwen definition, essence and term human. Each beeing more complex logical construct. Humans born exists and self realise in society. Human is an social animal, that thinks, work, and talk. Replcants as a replicated himan. Androids human like robots intercepted to showcase and highlight it. How human become dehumanised and robot or relicants humanised. Electronic shows consiquences of carefree people that has been replaced by adcancied machine look alike. Blade runner dwels upon search of humanity as essense from replicated human. With biblical referenses shwos condtradiction of dehumased noir indiference of socium with gigantic social economical gap. And pinpoint cyberpunk maximas as social dramma where noir substituted with color oversaturation. Venerires insted of the truth. Illustions for dreams. Ghost in shell dwels onbordrline of human and machine ofcorse organism is highter from of mechanicla with chemical relation in between. Introduces high fps, drwawing with akira, 1ns animation that inspired realaction for matrix watchowkis brothers.

Avant guarde synth pop is Alex foxxes underpass is a good inspiration withthat showcasing synthetic and industrial. Vocals not aged that well on contaterry moder dream gaze with mixture of hard hitting rhythms is essential for visualisation. High gopes and romantisimm of melodies gives that bloom and flame over foggym, gloom, moody city scapes. With modern rought cant diamonds like twin tribes and mareis is aand unique hidden gemostones to proboke digital inspiration. Modern techno and synthetic electronics dwells on more tech side of cyberpunk revelves arrond egocentrism and superiority which is a biit alien to cyberpunk as whole. Difference can be highlighted by diferences between modern EDM Main room house and underground, warehouse techno or even some melocis style where kind of rap, egocentrism is not really welcome. It dwels more on collective inclusivity are you true enoght then superiority i am and we are cooler then you or them still having those things but not as crutial to them. Tech side can be mechanical, gritless executuin which can depict monoloth or urban sides of this aesthetic but its more about shell without ghsot is just a hard metal surface. It requires human, dialectic contrast of man and machine, delusion, hopes and fears in technical jungle.

Phylosophy deals with system of which knowledge is build upon. Its a science about common universal laws of nature, socum and thinking. Part of phylosophy which is formal logic which mathematics are based upon. Ihave a relu of excluded 3rd in foundation. Meaning A is either = B or not = B. Everything that dosnt fit here is contractory therefore wrong in such form of logics. Lohic that systemise all phylosophical and formal logical brunches in one system called Dialectic Logic. Science of contradictions. It includes cotradictions and systemised freeform rules of formal logic into evoving from each other not given without prooving. Its based upon including as A can = and not equal B at the same time. Emotional contradictions of recent Ghost in shell are missrepresented of ucnarate invision of humationt, army hierarche and discpiline and giving oposite emotion of unempatheric and negation whic are just the other side of same coin and not contrtary to humane. Science of logic is based no on visions but on terms. Vision s meaning not pire knwledge has only parts of thruth. Emotional center especialy emotional pain is signal from brain for absence or incomplete knowledge. Terms pire truths, things that you completely understand dosnt hurt you emotinal center its emotinaly manajable and you dont hink about it. Its develping from young age. Our perception of uncomfortable changes from random falling to bad exams, to realtionship issues are to more life threatning and providnign problems. Terms brings ease, confidence, approach to create visionaries thus logic side of them and ability to trigger emotions. Violation of lofical ststem brings dumbnes,, dullnes and disgust. In modrn cinemat its great visualistation that conside each of those realations of sustem to crate visual side. Story vise absence of motivation, correct realtion between bsials is rpesented in ?? wiill bring a mere shade of interest. WE can take previously worked solid stories adapt them to certain degree in new enviroment to create much stronger interesting and emotionaly responsing for example not dumb down cut loose prevously mastered executid ways of movie. If you tell that there is a humans and replicants. Replicatnd detected by empathy. Replicant used to servince. New model runaway. Humans ask to catch them. He explains seeded visions. Her percieves unreals visionse, highly contrasted with enivroment. Another replicant joins him. He empathise. He catches replicants poeple tell him that hes done a mansjob, and give him object they show about replicant gitl. from his vision He runs away Beurifull from visi visions continious story. What to do to develope further Create humanity based version In antogonisation of pure?? Make a and replicant ?? That kills ch?? That all people hate and scare Make detective search for him. Show them even theory humand are enimes replicants distaste such human and hunt down hi// there//? By beeing more human forward then enemy. Cyberpingk 2079 Aspire as gta V With clear vision of hopelesness poor delusion and escapism Dark frim and hopeless yet technologicaly advanced. Where morality is one big blur. Dark humour, grim descions and social shithole as for homeles as for rich.
