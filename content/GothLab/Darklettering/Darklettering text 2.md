darklettering seems to use gothic as a foundation

Born to look raw and rough and to be read secondly

Varieys from metal hardcore to chicano glamour

Merges with gothic, lettering, type, tattoo, dark scripts and brush lettering

Mostly its a serie of effects to get ?, blobbed, distorted and trippy letters.

Utilizing heavy and low contrasts

It seems all comes down to visual noise, filling of gaps with dust, leaves, dots and splatters. 

It cherishes dead, developed, pushed to the limits images and construct, balancing on the tip of a blade. 

Leaving petals, ashes, smog and smoke behind. 

Damage, Nature. Falourshes and ocants intercept with stone, steel and darkness.

Clawed beasts, tyring to sting with their spurs.

Born violated or damage of virtuous.

From shine of metal, engravings to molded, rusted, corrupted textures. 

Dripping wrath, blown by wind, melted in acid and entangled in poison ivy and web.

Brokened and overbloomed, ekibana, life and death.
