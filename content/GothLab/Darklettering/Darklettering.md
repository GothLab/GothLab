        in its core dead lettering construct can use almost any style as foundation. Typycaly its an exedurated gothic font in its core cos it was one of the diffinitive constructs that uses models and which goal is to look at mostly and readed scondary. U can uise all typographic principles also im not gona enter metal logos prinicples at it exadurates gothic constrac by eextending elements kind of like chicano hip hop style but with more agressive decoratiopns.
    -   Second  
        Darklettering uses gothic astetic as a fondations as most of modern calligraphy and lettering. Mostly used for creating decorative pieces. To create visual look, meaning a vision like on fashion there is a gothic look which can vary in outfits but convey certain aesthetic, emotion. Which is primary goal of art as oppose to more blured bague - religious view and concrete, dry, cut to the point scinitific thinking in terms on the other side of spectrum. Meaning that lot of cariets can be applied and work, convey and impact without strict formula, method but not imaterial, vague, unclarified religious thinking? Still lettering part of term implyes use of graphical rules and terms which litters are based on, so they would conisder as such. Meaning that it has as all lettering and calligraphy has a dual nature of requirement of being readeblae letters which construct words and to exite, covey certain look, easthtic with emphasis on last as any artistic form suggest. Darkletteing is quite and umbrella term, mostly emplies raw, raugh, dark, moody look of pieces. From metal hardcore mosnters to chic chicano flavours. Used primarely in rock, metal arts and tatloo lettering. To create such gloomy art bungcg of effects can be applied. - Blobbed - Distortion - Trippy Utilizing from middle to low contrast mostly.
    -   Third  
        religious thining deals a lot with emotions. Kids like. What gives pleasure, feels or looks or sound bright, calm, funny that considered as good. Whats worrying, fearfuul,upleasend is bad. While growing we realise that medicine is unpleasent, yet good. Basis of relgious htinkig is hope not faith. When you not actively trying to coprehed, understand but merely passively hope it will end up good. Vision wise is attatches more visual and contextual stimulus. It creates vision of certain ideas and emotions for you to believe in. Meaning still not knowing but expecting that its true based on those stimulus. Most of media today appeal to those emotions and explot, overstumulate them under venier without clatiry of what its about such as creativery, truth, justice, goodnes, succes with trying or deteriming in clear, logical, comprehandable terms. So our 666 can be viewed as satanic, evil and troung in chic creative tone in some instagram, counter mainstream in music. Yet varying acriss something unclear and unknown. So you merely sugest its nature and not trying to define it. Smoke and mirrors 101. Whcih comes to sloid term wise systematic where term should be part of bigger picture, or sysytem and acknowledge as a whole it would be just as true and fit or to be false but shoud show how and why it can work under certain curmostances.
    -   Fourth  
        Vision Base of vision or look is about not kniwng It creates sort of illusion like futuristc hologram user displaying in movient went to appear sophisticated meanwhile it just overlodade, uncoprehandable mess, far away from clarity. It hase deliberately unfull but more cleared, absutrcted from fog of unkown but not fully to imply imagination. In the same way but more religous view of world works bu having lack of true or false knowledge or the truth meaning understang it as a whole, a accordiation of term with object and accordiation of object with term if we deal with creating such. Meaning if term is fully acknowledging an object its the truth. If you create and object and it fully ackowldging a term its the truth. For example 666. Whole notion can create discomfort, emotianal dissonance and it singinfu lack any contesxt so we add it by implying satanism, christianity, devil, metal musc, disobediance, marginalism. Once again it can be only if you lack knowldge , cos more chance s than not you cant tell what it means we just know situations when and where it is ment=ioned. Thats the basis of religious fear or by the same token awe in other things simply beacouse of lack of knowledge that should be filled with imagination. Our breain can imagine only thing it saw or know. Thoght exists only in words. Though you need to know that are conisder to be thouts and what considered to be existance to fully comprehand this, still well cover it in videos to come. You cant imagine somthing that you havnt seen. Meaning if you imagin a three headed dog with 9 tails and pink srry anime eyes or whatever all your visuon will be constructed from things that you already somwhere seen. Full and complete knowledge generates confidance, elimintaes fear or emitoanl pain and discomfort. 666 in original text is not even those digits so it already elimnates any signifacnece as arabic representation in 3 digits. But in days when book of revelatins was written it was a thing to cyper words in digits. 666 or number of beast. And term 4th Roman. Has a more solid explanation as Neron wchich was a best for chirstians that time. And numerical values of coins with his portarit considsts of numbers each represent NRN KAESAR. And summs up into number not digits of beast. A lot of darklettering comes with bunch of digital noise. It fills areas of letters with dust, leaves, dots and splatters. Dwells on developed, mortified, pished to the limits constructs.

        darklettering seems to use gothic as a foundation Born to look raw and rough and to be read secondly Varieys from metal hardcore to chicano glamour Merges with gothic, lettering, type, tattoo, dark scripts and brush lettering Mostly its a serie of effects to get ?, blobbed, distorted and trippy letters. Utilizing heavy and low contrasts It seems all comes down to visual noise, filling of gaps with dust, leaves, dots and splatters. It cherishes dead, developed, pushed to the limits images and construct, balancing on the tip of a blade. Leaving petals, ashes, smog and smoke behind. Damage, Nature. Falourshes and ocants intercept with stone, steel and darkness. Clawed beasts, tyring to sting with their spurs. Born violated or damage of virtuous. From shine of metal, engravings to molded, rusted, corrupted textures. Dripping wrath, blown by wind, melted in acid and entangled in poison ivy and web. Brokened and overbloomed, ekibana, life and death.
