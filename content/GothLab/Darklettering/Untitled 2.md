Vision

Base of vision or look is about not kniwng 

It creates sort of illusion like futuristc hologram user displaying in movient went to appear sophisticated meanwhile it just overlodade, uncoprehandable mess, far away from clarity.

It hase deliberately unfull but more cleared, absutrcted from fog of unkown but not fully to imply imagination.

In the same way but more religous view of world works bu having lack of true or false knowledge or the truth meaning understang it as a whole, a accordiation of term with object and accordiation of object with term if we deal with creating such.

Meaning if term is fully acknowledging an object its the truth. If you create and object and it fully ackowldging a term its the truth.

For example 666.
Whole notion can create discomfort, emotianal dissonance and it singinfu lack any contesxt so we add it by implying satanism, christianity, devil, metal musc, disobediance, marginalism. Once again it can be only if you lack knowldge , cos more chance s than not you cant tell what it means we just know situations when and where it is ment=ioned.

Thats the basis of religious fear or by the same token awe in other things simply beacouse of lack of knowledge that should be filled with imagination.

Our breain can imagine only thing it saw or know.

Thoght exists only in words. 
Though you need to know that are conisder to be thouts and what considered to be existance to fully comprehand this, still well cover it in videos to come.

You cant imagine somthing that you havnt seen. Meaning if you imagin a three headed dog with 9 tails and pink srry anime eyes or whatever all your visuon will be constructed from things that you already somwhere seen. 

Full and complete knowledge generates confidance, elimintaes fear or emitoanl pain and discomfort.

666 in original text is not even those digits so it already elimnates any signifacnece as arabic representation in 3 digits.

But in days when book of revelatins was written it was a thing to cyper words in digits.

666 or number of beast. And term 4th Roman.
Has a more solid explanation as Neron wchich was a best for chirstians that time. And numerical values of coins with his portarit considsts of numbers
each represent NRN KAESAR. And summs up into 
number not digits of beast. 

A lot of darklettering comes with bunch of digital noise.

It fills areas of letters with dust, leaves, dots and splatters. Dwells on developed, mortified, pished to the limits constructs.
