**What're other types of gothic compositions?**
	At first practice basic compositions that we discussed in previous "Composition" chapter. Next step will be writing letters into circle, square and rectangle shape.

Main goal here is to choose certain type of letter that it fit properly with others arround. Approach sides of geometrical shapes as a borders, which you shouldnt cross.

TO achieve that you need to know different versions of letters and be able to bend their structure in order to fit your composition.

**Inner Game**

**I write and hand and head start aching, what to do?**
	Practice of any activity can lead you feeling better, worser or nether of both. Less care attitude will lower you anxiety towards end result. Achieve it and maintain through all practice. You'll see how nice your letters gonna be and when not - you'll be perfectly fine.

**Writing a lot, but nothing cool comes, Its bugging me...**
	If you start writing 100% hard on yourself - you'll burn out fast and chances that you'll make good piece are close to 0%. Imagine you left your home and start running - do you start from running full speed, maximum endurance?

Did you saw any artists or pro calligraphers who struggle when work?

You should write with 40-50% of your abilities, with ease. After practice quality will grow and ease will remain.
	How to avoid mistakes?
		Common paradox. Desire to become "great" and sumontaniously avoid any bad results. We believe that success is when you make no bad works, you just create great things easily. Success is ideal outcome, forever.

Failure - is bad outcome.

Interesting thing that "Success" in most languages meant different thing than today.

Success from Latin "successus" meant mearly a "result" an outcome", "result of an attempt".

Another words in order to have a "success" you had to - make an attempt.

In order not to have a "success" you had to make no attempts.

With time we start to use word "successful" only as an "certain type" of results. So now you can't tell when you successful or not. The gradation of being successful / unsuccessful became unclear.

Your understanding of things works same as "html code" works on "site". On a site we see only result of a coding.

If coding has a mistake, site will not

	Alphabet CAPITALS, KADELS, VEP.SALS
		What is Capital?
			Gothic fonts pioneered appearance capital and stroke (minuscule) letters in same line of text. Capital letters are written in the same way as stroke ones - using singles strokes. As today with them, we start the sentences.
		What is Versal?
			It is a capita], letter that builded using more then one strokes. Usually it is a big, grand letter in decorative square that starts chapter (verse) of a book.
		What is Kadel?
			Kadel or Codeaux is sophisticated version of Versal. It constructed from big amount of strokes. They look very complex and were used mostly as initials emblem or Versals.
		How to create individual Capital Letter?
			At first lets meet different types of of main stems, connecting variations and variety of letter forms.

Alphabet capital exersice

Stems and connecting alphabet from fraktur, bastard etc.
		How many fonts of Capitals exist?
			There are few Old Calligraphy Capitals fonts that looks good today. There are hundred ways to make capital letter, because there are less restrictions to them.
Capital letter start's our composition and plays big part of making your work unique.
Learn different ways of building main stems and you'll be able to make different capital variation's.
Here we'll learn modern, geometric version of capitals. Letters packed in groups to show there similarity in construction.
	Compoisition
		How to make mesh?
			Mesh is a way to compose your words to create intensive, overloaded calligraphic piece. Gothic font is used not as an information but mostly
like texture with which we create other shapes. Form can be more geometrical like circles, triangles, squares or even portraits and shapes of animals or simply artistic splat.
Sharpenes of inner elements, good positioning of letters and focus on bigger picture is important for making balanced and impressive meshes.
If youll make letters to close then can bend into just a mess, if youll be too atached to letters not form that they create, they can end up as a dull piece without dynamic.
		How to make Pattern?
			Pattern can be similar to objective meshes but its more orieneted to create seamless textural effect that fills object not neccecarily creates it.
Whole composition can be created by repeating certain elements or using gothic text as a fill. To make rich and filled gothic pattern make
each letter take as more avalible space as possible. That there will be as less white wholes as
		What's the process of designing?
			Ways of creating always changes from artist to artist. But most of the times it involves following steps:

1)	Imagine an idea of how letters can be arranged.

2)	Discover a way that all letters work togather.

3)	Eliminating all flaws - things you know are not good enough.
	basically Like a photo consist of small dots or pixels, but they can become blurred when you resize them. (Programs like Photoshop, GIMP)
When you design your piece - find some interesting letters combinations and legatures.

After finding the acceptable composition, we can take a photo of it or scan it and then alter in application, thats would be beneficial if we need to make a logo.

You can develope the form in photoshop and then vectorize it in illustrator or other vector graphic editors.

A lot of sketching and art is dull proccess. On one hand you need to make a better result and youll achieve it by hard working,
on the other you need to stay interested and not burn or dry out throught the proccess. So comfortable atmosphere, music,
coffie, friends talk, cool experience, adrenalin is neccesary. Its like convertation of your fun to better result in your work.
From your fun to the paper.
	How do I make an image same as in my head?
		Transferring images from your head is impossible.

Your imagination gives you unclear image of result that exceeds your abilities. Abilities - are previous positive achievements,
something that you can do stabile. And most unfortunate that it gives you hope for emotions when you achieve it. This is called - fantasy.
You think if your image will be 100% same as in your then it will be beautiful, ideal and perfect. And you'll be happy.
Then you try to achieve it and you couldn’t.
You can think “If I imagined it in my head - then I can make it real." - it's not the case when you're beginner.
Your goal is to stay calm and moving towards the end result without a race. Whole process after months of practice will
be quite boring, plain, work which in the end will give you magnificent result
which will excite viewer.
Images in your head comes from works that you saw on internet.
You want to amaze other people as much as you've been amazed.
Artist who can create quality of works that can create such emotion for you -have two times more experience minimum, then you do.
Otherwise you wouldn't be so impressed.
	Focus your practice on:
		1-	2 months

Quantity - the more the better, sketch out as much as you can avoiding judgement. Get a grip with a pen.

2-	3 moths

Calmness and accuracy

Now go for calm and accurate letters and strokes. Slow and steady movements without a hush. You'll see improvements - cherish them.

3-	6 months

Quality + Break

At this stage you'll go for making works as better as you can. Develop your critical thinking and discipline in work on flaws and details.

Also at this period you probably would stop practicing and alter your goals, and probably comeback to practice in a couple of months with much better results.

Break through slow go for fast, exiting, experiment. Develop rules that applied to you and gives you better results.

Start your self education by figuring things on your own.

Forget about rules. Benefit from them.
	Where to start from?
		Commitment
			When you understand where you gonna post your image and committed to finish it -its time to generate ideas.
Our end goal is balanced, exiting composition. It achieves by searching for BIG IDEA (look, style, design).
Look at the transcerpt of designg logo for stoner, heavy metal band "Sleepy Door" and see how process is going.
It varyes from artists to artists and differes from time to time.
Goal is to alter already gothic logo of metal, stoner band.
	Imagine.
		Sketching ideas of the way letters work or can be arranged.

Discover. Coming up with Alphabet of letters that can work togather.
	If your composition not solid and sharp it can end up looking like a mess.
	What are the most common mistakes?
		1.	Crossing inside 2. Too long

3.Crossing border 4. Overloaded 5. Bend too much
		Big ammount of decorative elements -percieve as dirt. Managing your attitude towards them will be one of the hardest sticking points of your game.
	1. Hair strokes
		- grow from stem, not stick from them.

2,3,4. Hairlines should't merge, stick togather or cross throght next letter.
	How letters constructed?
		ertain letters has their own principles of construction. Order of thin and thick strokes.

1st and 3rd tables above shows right way

<	of construction.

2nd shows wrong order.

i	4th is when wrong order can look good.
	How to design gothic calligraphy/lettering piece?
		Start your design process from end goal. Size, structure and type of surface where it's gonna be used. For example if you want to design a small logo for a t-shirt brand - it should be clearly readable in small size, with sharp edges and be scalable. So most definetly we need vector file in the end (graphic in coordinates, that scales without distortion).

If it's a piece for your portfolio - make sure it looks good on a screen.

Calligraphy that looks good on paper rarely looks good on monitor, so digital editing is neccesity. To avoid computer editing - you can make a photo compoisition that showcases your work.
	How to edit my work on computer?
	Don't use Enamel or Acrylic paint to refill markers - they will destroy your marker.
	How to refill marker?
		1.	Screw out top section

2.	Take off pump valve 3. Refill marker

4.	Put on valve and top section back on.

Barrel of marker contains small metal balls - don't loose them. Use gloves to avoid dirt.

Use scrissors or tweesers to take off pump valve.

To write with marker - nib should be moistured with inks. Hold your marker verticaly,press nib back and forth hard against a surface couple of times. Inks will gradually fill the nib.
			Vector graphic would be preferable for logos.

Graphic that builded upon coordinates so it can be scaled wherever you like. (Programs like Illustrator, Corel Draw).

If its a big t-shirt print the clarity of edges and benefits of vector can be replaced with much easier and faster way to make - using raster graphic. Which
	Brushes. Grand Roman engravings were painted with brush before beeing cutted out. Writing gothic letters using it is very sophisticated and complex task. You can make broad strokes, show constrast of light and shade. But it requires great coordination and discipline. So if you'll get boared of markers - brush can be you next thing.
	Spray Paint - its a 5% of paint and 95% of enamels putted under pressure in a can with gas and metal balls inside of it to mix those elements. Different caps are responsible for different size of strokes, also there is a square nib (Montana Ultrawide) and even spray paint with decorative strokes (Montana Spider). Spraypaint is beeing rarely used for making gothic letters for its low possibility of control. Mostly used as an experimental tool. Montana Spider Texturised effect of spray paint
	Elements

Decorative Words and Letters
	What are decorative elements?

Imagine we design a calligraphy piece for a t-shirt,

we wrote our word with basic gothic letters,

but there are a lot of space between some letters, whole word looks unbalanced and dull.

So we adding drips to fill white space, hairlines and extended strokes to letters to make them more interesting,
finishing by crossing large strokes undeneath word. Elements that helped us solve those problems are called - decorative.
	How many I should use them?

At first you'll gonna use them a lot. Reasonable usage of decorative elements achieved by understanding - what problems they're solving.

Mirage

Combination

of vanished strokes and splatters makes all word look less compressed
	Where did they came from?

Architectural styles, painting, sculpting all it draw their inspiration and material to work from - nature.

Shapes of leaves, human body, woods and landscapes, proportions.

All swirls that we know today has their original in nature. Form of I on top of columns was shape of Achante plant. Contrast of tree stem and its brunches very simmilar with gothic letters which were also decorated with ! leaves, curves of leaves is most appealing for swooshes, angle of grass - for flourishes.

In the end of the day your work should look good, and not necessarily correct and "right".

All rules and recommendations shows you a short way to achieve positive results in the beginning.
	Swashes - extended elements of letters. Makes compostion look wider and dynamic by adding it to the last character.
	Flourishes - Decorative strokes under word. Use to fill white gaps underneath word and to create stable foundation for it. Can be combined with descending elements of letters.
	Hairlines - thin lines written from stem of letters. Use to give straight lines of letters some movement. Use in between of them - to connect letters in one dynamic form. If you cross hairlines make sure they don't stick togather.
	Spurs - sharp edges of letters. Use by adding them to middle or bottom of letter to make it look more evil. Make sure middle spikes centered on same level in word.
	Diamonds - square dots that fill gaps, mostly used in capial letters. Open and close piece with them to emphasize meaning of the word and make it look more solid.
	Dots - inks splatters that creates artistic noise. Use to fill white gaps or break to sharp and clean letters. Drips can be splashed to whole compostion or to certain parts of it using photoshop brushes.
	In the same way most if not all of gothic calligraphy representations of that times are books of pray and rewritings of elimintaitng holy scripts.
	How Modern Gothic Calligraphy was founded? Experiments with fonts took place even in medieval times, nowadays we reinvent those practices applying new technics, materials, instruments and approaches to to make it.

Gothic surround us and show different aspects of its nature. From newspaper headers to gangs graffiti, from hip-hop tattoos to hard rock bands album covers.

Nowadays graffiti combined with gothic calligraphy merged into - calligraffiti. With help of hundreds young artists - it became one of the most popular and exciting art forms of this decade.
	How gothic looks today?
		

Nowadays to feel difference approach it like music:
each style have its own principles and sub genres with same core base but variable, distinguishable elements.
Like classic rock gonna be different from hard rock, trash metal, emo core.
But all of them have its own - rock (blues) core.
Same here, each font that we develope or learn and write has its basic core. Principles of contrast, connecting and
skeleton of each letter that distingush itself from scripts, sans serif fonts.
Thought today we can view it as trending, hipster looking calligraphy its still speaks very raw, agressive and dark newetherless
we can make it look nicier, calmer and softer.
	profound role in development of art and culture that we have today.
	things in any area is a matter of time, discipline, knowledge and love.

Your ability to create beutifull gothic calligraphy is not prmise you eternal happines, lots of attention from people,
money, love. Grow up, its a fake ideas that can lead you to the depression. Luckly we will discus those things furhtermore
in Inner Game section of this book.
	How long calligraphy will be popular?

Today calligraphy - especially brush pen logos, gothic sketches and lettering are trending. People like to see beautiful writing,
companies want to be more close with clients, artists want to be recognized and cherished.

A lot of attention to calligraphy and lettering began not so long ago and definitely on its peak of interest to it.

			Refills, markers and nibs can be bought in graffiti shops or art stores. Hard surfaces such as concrete walls will with
time will wear off your nibs - so buy couple of additional. To achieve thin connecting lines - ('cut your nib on one side (with office blade) to pyramid shape-r
You can refill marker with dye inks (more I liquid and have intense, glossy color) or acrylic (thick like paint with wider color range and matte texture).
		How to change colors in marker?
			Markers can be refilled with different type and color of inks.

Before refilling with different color -clean marker barrel and pump with solvent, and change a nib.

Better to have different markers for different colors.

We are talking about graffiti paint markers. Not Basic permanent or special calligraphy markers with soft or hard nibs - they are not practical for gothic calligraphy.
		How to write on walls and canvases?
			Writing all the with pilot gets boring.

To sharpen your skills furthermore you need to change tools, surfaces, colors

Also you'll tend to learn different''types of calligraphy - explore beyond gothic grounds.

Markers are best for walls, wood, plastic and metal surfaces. You can use wide	, .

brushes also - but markers are	easier to use
		Which marker to choose?
			There are a lot of different sizes of marker nibs. Best to start with standard Molotow (2.5cm or ?")
to get the picture and then use Molotow Masterpice (6cm/3") on big surfaces.
With Masterpiece you can make big letters and sharp them up with smaller marker’s-
	Define your alphabet. If words doesn't look right in different ways - take each letter of your words and make different versions of it.
Build them by one next to each other. Make their lines fit between themselves so there were no wide space between nor less of of it.
You complete whole row undtill it workds - like a tetris game.

History
	History
		Evolution of gothic Fonts
		Whats the point in Gothic art?
			Gothic style is very sophisticated, complex yet attractive.
Till our days one of the main Gothic Art stamps are cathedrals.
Grand decoration of cathedrals were used to stand out
from all other building in area.
House of God as any position itself - most of the times should
have very rich and impressive building that demonstrates power and divines of this place.
In ancient times church had the most influence to rule country along with its leaders, wherever
it were monarchs or ministers or generals.
		How Gothic style was founded?
			Gothic transcends special type of emotion, mood, esthetic - which broadcasts through
art, poetry, sculpture and calligraphy. At the rise of Gothic whole art served only
decorative purposes. Artistry in that time wasn't something respectful. It was
one of the crafts that involved manual labor, which wasn't noble thing to do.
There was no attention to artists as an individual, no interest in his personal
views on this work, politics or life as we have nowadays.
		How style spread across Europe?
			It spread in a lot because of Gothic irchitecture that became widely popular at :hat time.
Many cathedrals in different variations of that style nowadays represents - best sights of cities all iver Europe.
They were build by local irchitects that were using French cathedrals as a reference.
		Why cathedrals were build in this style?
			Because of iths sophisticated look. Cathedral with large halls, ambient light
was creating a vision in minds of people that this building is the place of something unique, holy and grand.
	Early Gothic
		?? Century. Font that have both qualities of upcomming Gothic Textura and previous '■^fficial' hand Caroline Minuscule.
	Modern calligraphy artists turned it's formal appearance into agressive, urbanised and complex visual form. Saving most of traditional construction methods and contrast of strokes. Nowadays term "gothic" also applies in America for sans serif fonts.
	Bastarda Secreatary English / Batarde

French / 17th Germany Fraktur
	Bastard's
		There are couple of alterations of mixing cursive script and gothic letters - all of them called Bastard (child born out of marriage). They're smaller in proportions comparing to Textura.
	Gothic Textura (Blackletter, Old English)
		Textura Quadrata and Prescisus - are most distinguish fonts that represents essence of gothic medieval style. Pages of text writen with those same alike letters merges in a pattern or texture.
Because of this effect - gothic texts can be hard to read. Chracters visualy merge togather. To distinguish some of them, first time in a history - strokes and later dots above "i" and "j" appears.
Biggest distingtion between those two fonts is that Quadrata has a square foot, while Prescisus - flat. Also Gothic texts pioneered use of capital and small letters within one text.
	Rotunda
		Interesting phenomenon took place in Italy. It's resisted French Gothic tendencies and made their own versions of Gothic Art, Architecture and Calligraphy. Their rounded form of Caroline Minuscule called Rotunda (round).
	Why we still use it?
		Those fonts still used headlines, street signs, book covers for its formal and historical look. In the same way Gangs and rock bands use it for its evil, raw and strong appearance.

Aesthetics
	fhat shapes Gothic style tries to mimic?
		'If you want to find yourself most talented mentor - learn from mother nature itself."

tost ending of columns used shape of "Acanthus” plant leafs.

Flourishes of letters, contrast of forms are have their natural reference.

«hole rise and development of Gothic art is possible due close relationtips with churches.
Religion played significant part in life of people of previous era. Architecture, Paintings,
Music and Calligraphy have their spin in development becouse of their connection with religion.
Note that most architecture represents cathedrals, most calligraphy books - books of pray, art -
icons and religion themes. Nowadays we lost the close relationship between art and religion.
We treat religion as a joke, while it serves
	Why we use gothic style?
		Main thing to remember is when we write Gothic - we create darks, aggressive,
sophisticated atmosphere. We bring complex
emotion to the table of viewers. Challenge them to read and percieve our letters
that wroted not in the most easiest way but way that provokes interests of viewing
complex, vibrant ordered chaos.
	How to find my style?
		Style is your individual approach and experience that allows to distinguish your work from other artists. It's most hard area for all artisian's.
There is no working instructions "how to find it". It takes couple years of practice and most certanly urge to create good works.
Style is something that comes when your desire to be creative matches your ability to stick to whats works best for you.
It's a set of rules that works for you and developed, tested and approved by you.
Practice of any skill have it's - low points. You'll have moments when you feel lonely, sad and on emotional end.
In that moments you'll have to answer yourself that "is it what you want to do?".
Yes or No.
You'll find yourself practicing, strugling ’	for weeks without satistfactionable results. You'll be doubting yourself,
getting angry at other people and
yourself. You'll distance yourself from your practices and will try somehting else. Then come back to it and realise that you became pretty good at it.
You can not achieve stunning results, fame, abiility to sell your works. And still you need to answer this question -"Is it what you want to do?" Yes or No.
Your experience of calligraphy is much more important than end result.
Walk in a park has no desitination rather then enjoyment.Your progress is a chance to continue you work and be involved in different projects.

There is no end after beeing good at it. There is no end to a game.

Experience is your gift and your payment. Everything you know you can do - means that you met its requirements.
	How many versions of gothic fonts there are?
		Textura hand spread through Europe and blend with common script hands of that area. After that fusion
it became hardly possible to count how many versions of bastard fonts there were. Hands altered from
country to country, from city to city, from scribe to scribe.

Visually - idea behind those fonts was the same, but elements and manner of application varied.
	Which fonts are Gothic?
		Today we call them - Medieval, Old English, German, Blackletter, Medieval ; Gangs, Hip Hop, Evil etc.
Al those terms describe one style that had spread across Europe and played—significant part in determination of it's culture in ХГ- 4 XVII ??-?? centuries.

	What is lettering?
		Lettering is when you draw letters. Calligraphy is when you write words.
	Why make lettering?
		To make sophisticated and dynamic gothic letters, from the first time with calligraphy - you'll need years of practice and hours of patience.

With lettering you can correct your mistakes easily.
	Sketch your guesses.
		Good compoisiton most of the times is a discovery not a knowledge. Experience and "thinking through" will help you to choose right way to go. Sketching of different options and positioning of words is the walking.
	How to make lettering?
		Approach to make it differs from artist to artist. There are several ways to do it. We will describe easiest and longest one, you can alter it to meet your needs.
	Read between the words.
		Undesrtanding interconnection of letters in your words - is the most essential aspect of work.
Your goal to make them look right with each other. Some letters togather look too close, some too similar,
some elements repeats and you need to find a way to make them work togather.
Lenght of a word defines how you gonna station them on a piece.
Wherever they gonna be written in one line, two lines. From left corner or under each other.
	What tools do I need?
		Mechanical pencil for sharp lines for sketching your composition and letters. Eraser - to delete unnesasary edges and unsatisfactory elements. Liner or Capilaric pen to trace your image before scanning.
	Lettering practice
		Not all the time you need' to make your sketches good with pilot, you can use it as a brush as a drawing tool. Justidiraw,
sketch your letters to build composition. Use pencil in the same way.
You know already how to build gothic letters so draw them using pencil.
You can make lots of flows and details that are really hard to master using pilot.
	Resketch
		You can redraw your working composition till you get perfection using pilot but more
comfartable way is to use tracing paper.
Just layer it on top of your work and redraw your letters, correcting them on the way.
Also you can redraw it using pencil, and fill it with capilar ink pen.

Practice your way, try different methods and sol problems and obsticles - your way
Thats what artist should do always. Solve problems - your own way.
